Previous ideas
===========
A community built around ideas. User generated database of ideas and proposals acted on by developers looking for some inspiration or just wanting something to keep them busy.


Overview
-----------
When someone comes up with an idea but does not have the technical knowledge or time to make it a reality they submit this idea to IdeaHub. Other users can then rate this idea, give feedback, offer suggestions and express interest in the project.

Developers who are looking for a project to undertake can then browse the list of ideas for something they would like to contribute to. They do not have to disclose that they have started looking at a project but the best case would be to include a link to a git repository so others can offer their own assistance.

If a developer would like to help on a project but may be lacking in certain knowledge they can express interest in working on the project but will include what areas of expertise they are looking for. This will then alert users with those skills to see if they would consider assisting. The idea is to get people working together using open source techniques to build on the ideas and create beautiful solutions. Therefore collaboration is highly encouraged through the use of repositories, issue tracking and other services.

Apart from these public ideas users can also use the service to manage their own idea and project list in a private environment. These ideas will only be visible to the user and anyone they choose to share it with. The same tools will be available for these projects as public ones. Users will be encouraged to share these projects with the community once completed, but is not a requirement.
